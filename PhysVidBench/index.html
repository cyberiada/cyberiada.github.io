The hand carefully maneuvers the relatively thin but dense phone over the circular opening of an empty, transparent drinking glass made of rigid glass, which sits stably on the flat surface of a nightstand. The hand then lowers the smartphone vertically into the hollow space within the glass until the bottom edge of the phone makes contact with the inner bottom surface of the glass."},

        {src: "assets/PhysVidBench/images/videos/ltx/49.mp4", caption: "A pair of hands firmly grips the sides of a lightweight, empty plastic water bottle, its flexible walls yielding under pressure. The hands squeeze inwards, visibly deforming the bottle and forcing air out through its narrow circular opening. While maintaining the squeeze, the hands carefully maneuver the bottle downwards until the opening is positioned directly over a single, intact, spherical yellow egg yolk resting within the viscous, clear egg white in a smooth, hard bowl. The opening hovers just above the yolk's delicate surface. The hands then gradually relax their grip. The inherent elasticity of the plastic causes the bottle walls to spring back outwards, increasing the internal volume and creating a partial vacuum. The external air pressure consequently pushes the deformable yolk upwards through the opening and into the bottle, separating it from the egg white which remains largely behind in the bowl."},

They exhale deeply, inflating the bag with air, the plastic expanding and becoming taut. Once mostly full and balloon-like, they twist the bag's opening tightly to contain the air pressure. With their other hand, they stretch a brown rubber band, its elasticity allowing it to expand, and loop it several times around the twisted neck of the bag, securing it closed. The filled bag, now resembling a puffy, rectangular pillow, rests on the grassy ground outdoors."}

            Recent progress in text-to-video (T2V) generation has enabled the synthesis of visually compelling and temporally coherent videos from natural language. However, these models often fall short in basic physical commonsense, producing outputs that violate intuitive expectations around causality, object behavior, and tool use. Addressing this gap, we present PhysVidBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the physical reasoning capabilities of T2V systems. The benchmark includes 383 carefully curated prompts, emphasizing tool use, material properties, and procedural interactions, and domains where physical plausibility is crucial. For each prompt, we generate videos using diverse state-of-the-art models and adopt a three-stage evaluation pipeline: (1) formulate grounded physics questions from the prompt, (2) caption the generated video with a vision-language model, and (3) task a language model to answer several physics-involved questions using only the caption. This indirect strategy circumvents common hallucination issues in direct video-based evaluation. By highlighting affordances and tool-mediated actions, areas overlooked in current T2V evaluations, PhysVidBench provides a structured, interpretable framework for assessing physical commonsense in generative video models.        <br>

      <strong>Video Generation Pipeline.</strong> An overview of the four-stage pipeline used to construct
      PhysVidBench. We begin with correct solutions from the PIQA dataset and filter them using a large
      language model (LLM) to identify instances of secondary tool use and object affordances (Stage 1).
      These filtered solutions are converted into short, physically grounded video generation prompts via
      another LLM pass (Stage 2). Each base prompt is further upsampled to enhance its physical specificity
      and causal structure while preserving the original scene (Stage 3). Both base and upsampled prompts
      are fed into a diverse set of state-of-the-art text-to-video generation models, resulting in videos that
      probe tool interaction and physical commonsense (Stage 4).

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      We present evaluation results for 12 state-of-the-art video generation models using PhysVidBench, which measures physical commonsense understanding across seven fine-grained dimensions, Action Understanding, Force & Motion, Fundamental Physics, Material Interaction, Object Properties, Spatial Reasoning, and Temporal Dynamics, along with an overall average. Each model is tested under two prompt variants: base prompts derived directly from PIQA answer texts, and upsampled prompts that enrich physical details and causal structure.
    
      Across all models, upsampled prompts consistently yield higher scores, particularly in dimensions that benefit from explicit physical context, such as Object Properties, Force & Motion, and Material Interaction. This suggests that prompt engineering remains a critical factor in eliciting stronger physical reasoning from generative models. Despite these gains, most models still underperform in Spatial Reasoning and Temporal Dynamics, reflecting limitations in current architectures' ability to encode geometry, continuity, and causal flow over time.
      
      Interestingly, while larger models such as Wan2.1 14B and Cosmos 14B generally achieve higher scores, size alone does not guarantee robust physical understanding highlighting the need for improved objective functions, data, or inductive biases tailored to physical commonsense. Overall, PhysVidBench provides a clear and interpretable framework for diagnosing such gaps and benchmarking progress in physically grounded video generation.
