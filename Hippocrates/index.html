                          The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare promises to transform medical diagnostics, research, and patient care. Yet, the progression of medical LLMs faces obstacles such as complex training requirements, rigorous evaluation demands, and the dominance of proprietary models that restrict academic exploration. Transparent, comprehensive access to LLM resources is essential for advancing the field, fostering reproducibility, and encouraging innovation in healthcare AI. We present Hippocrates, an open-source LLM framework specifically developed for the medical domain. In stark contrast to previous efforts, it offers unrestricted access to its training datasets, codebase, checkpoints, and evaluation protocols. This open approach is designed to stimulate collaborative research, allowing the community to build upon, refine, and rigorously evaluate medical LLMs within a transparent ecosystem. Also, we introduce Hippo, a family of 7B models tailored for the medical domain, fine-tuned from Mistral and LLaMA2 through continual pre-training, instruction tuning, and reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback. Our models outperform existing open medical LLMs models by a large-margin, even surpassing models with 70B parameters. Through Hippocrates, we aspire to unlock the full potential of LLMs not just to advance medical knowledge and patient care but also to democratize the benefits of AI research in healthcare, making them available across the globe.

                        Figure 1. The evolution of medical LLM performances on the MedQA dataset. Our 7B Hippo-Mistral and Hippo-LLaMA models achieve 50.8% and 59.9% 5-shot accuracy, respectively. Hippo-Mistral outperforms all existing open models, including even those with 70B parameters.

                      <ul>
                        In this work, we provide full access to our framework, from the data sources to the training
                        configurations and the reproducible evaluation protocols. We conduct a detailed empirical
                        analysis to identify the impact of various design elements on LLM performance, leading to
                        a domain-adapted framework that demonstrates superior performance on multiple medical
                        benchmarks. Based on these insights, we develop a step-by-step guide for the efficient
                        training of medical-LLMs. Our research efforts yield two advanced 7B parameter models,
                        Hippo- and Hippo- . As shown in Figure 1, our models not only outperform existing 7B
                        and 13B models by a significant margin but also deliver results on par with, and in some
                        cases exceeding, those of 70B models. We argue that the development of a broad, varied
                        collection of open models is crucial for deepening our knowledge of language models and
                        enhancing their applicability across various domains.

                      <ul>
                        Figure 2 shows the overall workflow of the Hippocrates framework, starting from domain-
                        specific pre-training and progressing through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
                        learning from AI-generated feedback to an extensive evaluation phase. This pipeline ensures
                        our models are precisely tailored and rigorously tested for the medical domain. <br> <br>

                        <li><strong>Continued Pre-training Data.</strong> A key aspect of our methodology is the integration of specialized medical knowledge through an extensive pre-training corpus, assembled from three specialized datasets: Medical Guidelines, PMC-Patients, and PubMedQA-contexts. The Medical Guidelines dataset comprises clinical practice guidelines, is used for training Meditron models. The PMC-Patients dataset consists of patient summaries extracted from case reports within PubMed Central (PMC). Additionally, the PubMedQA-contexts dataset is constructed by extracting the context field of each sample in the training split of the benchmark PubMedQA. This extensive corpus, consisting of roughly 300M training tokens, forms the foundation of our models, ensuring their proficiency in navigating medical terminology and practices. We systematically assessed the impact of each dataset, both individually and in combination, to optimize our model's performance. <br>
                        <li><strong>General Instructions Data.</strong> This dataset aggregates more than 400K samples from nine different datasets, each derived from the instruction corpora of previous studies. By excluding data from the training or test splits of downstream QA benchmarks, we aim to minimize bias and improve the model's generalization capabilities across different reasoning tasks. A pre-processing protocol was employed to remove irrelevant noise such as superfluous words and web URLs, ensuring the data's quality and relevance.
                        <li><strong>Evaluation Instructions Data.</strong> This dataset was formed to examine the effects of including instruction samples directly from downstream tasks, a common practice in existing studies. Instruction-response pairs were crafted using the training splits of various benchmarks, following the templates established in Meditron. We conducted a series of experiments to assess the distinct influence of each split on each task, both individually and collectively.
                        <li><strong>Medical Preference Data.</strong> Constructing a preference dataset typically involves generating diverse responses to identical queries using LLMs, which are subsequently evaluated by human annotators to identify the most accurate response. This method, however, can become prohibitively expensive, both in terms of computation for generating responses and the financial and time investments required for manual annotation. To circumvent these issues, we leveraged the iCliniq-10k dataset, containing 10K authentic patient-doctor dialogues from icliniq.com. Each dialogue features a patient question accompanied by three different answers: one from an actual doctor, and the others from ChatGPT and ChatDoctor. We conducted a thorough preprocessing of this dataset to eliminate any irrelevant or extraneous information.
                        <li><strong>Medical RLAIF.</strong> To reduce annotation costs, we adopted the RLAIF methodology in the medical domain for the first time. Utilizing detailed prompts based on patient inquiries from the iCliniq-10k dataset, we used GPT4 to determine the optimal response based on predefined instructions. These instructions were derived from those used in qualitative assessments by medical professionals in Med-PaLM, with minor modifications. This annotation approach amounted to a cost of $120.
